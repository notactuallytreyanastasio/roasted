Title: I built an MCP that roasts you based on your browser history

I made a tool that analyzes your browser history and generates personalized roasts about your digital habits. It's brutal but hilarious.

Features:
- Multi-browser support (Chrome, Safari, Arc, Brave)
- 3 roast intensity levels (gentle → savage)
- Privacy-first (everything stays local)
- 5-minute setup with automated script

Example roast: "Your online shopping habit is single-handedly funding Jeff Bezos's space program"
